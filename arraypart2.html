        <h3>12. What is ceil and floor function and what is use of them. </h3>
        Answer: Ceil is math object method which round Upwards to nearest interger and return same.
        floor is math object method which round Downwards to nearest interger and return same.
        We can use both methods when we need to Round any number to Upwards/Downwards interger.

        <br><br>
        <h3>13.	What is round and how it is different from ceil and floor. </h3>
        Answer: round is math object method which round to  its nearest interger and return same.
        For example - If fraction value is greater than or equal to 0.5 then it round to it's Upwards nearest integer 
        and it fraction value is less than 0.5 then it round to it's Downwards nearest integer.

        <h3>14. What will be output for below codes and give reason for output</h3>
           
        1.	1 + “2” + “2” = "122"<br>
        Reason: "2" is a string and have operator + which act like concatenation. hence, "122" string;<br><br>
        2.	1+2+3 +”4” = "64"<br>
        Reason: (1+2+3) is interger values and will add up and return 6. However, "4" is string, so concatenation will happen and return "6" + "4" = "64"<br><br>
        3.	“4” + true = "4true"<br>
        Reason: :"4" is string. So true will converted as string and will return "4true" string.<br> <br>
        4.	“True” + true = "Truetrue"<br>
        Reason: "True" is string. So true will converted as string and will return "Truetrue" string.<br><br>
        5.	1 + true = 2<br>
        Reason: 1 is interger value and true holds as 1. So 1 + 1 will return 2.<br><br>
        6.	2 + false = 2<br>
        Reason: 2 is interger value and false holds as 0. So 2 + 0 will return 2.<br><br>
        7.	"4" * true = 4<br>
        Reason: Due to multiplication operator 4 will get converted to interger and true is 1. So 4 * 1 = 4 <br><br>
        8.	4 * “Af” = NaN<br>
        Reason: "Af" is not a number and not a boolean value. Also, there is multiplication operator. Hence, no operation will happen. <br><br>
        9.	"4" * "A" = NaN<br>
        Reason: "A" is not a number and not a boolean value. Also, there is multiplication operator. Hence, no operation will happen. <br><br>
        10.	 “4”*”4” = 16<br>
        Reason: Due to multiplication operator both string "4" will get converted to integer and multiplication will happen.<br><br>
        11.	4 + "4A" +10 =  "44A10"<br>
        Reason: "4A" is string and have + operator due to which 4 & 10 will get converted to strings and return it.<br><br>
        12.	4 + "4" * 10 = 44<br>
        Reason: First multiplication operation will happen where "4" is getting converted to integer and return 40. After that addition will happen 4 + 40.<br><br>
        13.	4 + "4A" * 10 = NaN<br>
        Reason: First multiplication operation will happen. However, "4A" is not number or not boolean. So not operation will happen and return NaN.<br><br>
        14.	4 + "true" * 10 = NaN<br>
        Reason: First multiplication operation will happen. However, "true" is not number or not boolean. So not operation will happen and return NaN.<br><br>
        15.	true *80 = 80<br>
        Reason: true is boolen value which hold 1. So multiplication will happen 1 * 80 = 80<br><br>
        16.	1 +2+ 3+ "ad" = "6ad"<br>
        Reason: First addition of (1 +2+ 3) will happen and return 6. However, "ad" is string and have + operator. So it covert 6 to string "6" and concatenation is happen.<br><br>
        17.	"1" +2+ 3 = "123"<br>
        Reason: "1" is string and have + operator which converts 2,3 to string and return "123" string.<br> <br>
        18.	"1" *2+ 3+8*"true" = NaN<br>
        Reason: "true" is not a number. Hence, no operation will happen and return NaN. <br><br>
        19.	true*0 + "false" = "0false"<br>
        Reason: First multiplication will happen. So true is 1 * 0 and return 0. "false" is string and have + operator. So it will concatenate "0" + "false".<br><br>
        20.	1 *2+ 3+8+"true" = "13true"<br>
        Reason: First 1*2 will happen and then it will add up to 3+8 = 13. Now, "true" is string and have + operator, due to which concatenation will happen.<br><br>
        21.	1 *null + true+10 + "10" = "1110"<br>
        Reason: First 1*null execute. However, anything multiple with null is zero. After 0 + true = 1. Then 1 + 10 = 11. "10" is string and + operator due to which concatenation will happen between 11 & "10" = "1110".
